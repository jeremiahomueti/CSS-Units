Percentage: A Percentage value is always relative to some other 
element. For example, if you set the width of some element, it
will be half the parent element.

width: 50%; //half that of the parent.


For some properties, they relative, not the parent itself, but 
to the font size of the element itself, or some other value of the 
property itself. How the other units work is really based on the 
property in question.


EMs are relative units to some other values, as are REMs.
